Project Name : Mapping the shortest distance between two points on the map of Edmonton, Alblerta based on Djikstra's Algprithm.

Running instructions: To run the program run the code in X forwarding, in main directory with files "soln" , "Makefile" , "README.md",
"submission_validator.py" run the command "cd soln/".

Inside the solution directory conatining files "Makefile" , "server" , "client" and "map" run the command "make clean" and 
then run the command "make".

On the opened map select the start vertex by clicking on map. To navigate through the map we can click and grab and to zoom in we can 
scroll in to zoom and scroll out to zoom out. To quit we click on the cross of the map.

Notes and Assumptions: 
We do not calculate the path for start Vertex = end Vertex.
